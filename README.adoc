== Requirements

As discussed previously, our documentation solution should have the following properties and features:

. Stored on a server, accessible by relevant people
.. Should be possible to link from confluence / email to the document
. Version control
. Commenting on changes
. Collaborative editing without conflicts
. Branching (e.g. different specs for different releases etc)
. Generate PDF for sharing to wider audience
. Offline editing


=== Proposed solution based on asciidoc

- Store system documents on Github as asciidoc documents
-- Possible alternative: Markdown
- VC, branching, commenting, and the whole authoring process are covered by Github toolchain (Pull requests etc)
- Locally, asciidoc files can be rendered using asciidoctor, pandoc e.g.
-- Simple toolchain and installation guide could easily be set up
- Documents can be authored in markup language either in the browser or locally
-- In-browser convenient preview, local editing allows for offline work

=== AsciiDoc vs MarkDown

- Markdown is a bit more mature, is used more widely and is simpler
- Asciidoc supports more features to allow writing even complex books

-> Github supports both
