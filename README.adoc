== Requirements

As discussed previously, our documentation solution should have the following properties and features:

. Stored on a server, accessible by relevant people
.. Should be possible to link from confluence / email to the document
. Version control
. Commenting on changes
. Collaborative editing without conflicts
. Branching, tagging (e.g. different specs for different releases etc)
. Generate PDF for sharing to wider audience
. Offline editing


=== Proposed solution based on asciidoc

* Store system documents on Github as asciidoc documents
** Possible alternative: Markdown
* VC, branching, tagging, commenting, and the whole authoring workflow are covered by Github toolchain (Pull requests etc)
* Locally, asciidoc files can be rendered using asciidoctor, pandoc e.g.
** Simple toolchain and installation guide could easily be set up
* Documents can be authored in markup language either in the browser or locally
** In-browser convenient preview, local editing allows for offline work

.Drawbacks
* Can't download pdf from Github webpage directly (convenience feature)
** Workarounds: java script booklet to remove the frames etc, and print from browser to pdf
* Needs github login
** For non-engineers, this would introduce a new tool

.Open questions
* One repo for all documents, or per document
** Tags are always for entire repo

=== AsciiDoc vs MarkDown

- Markdown is a bit more popular, has more tools and is simpler
- Asciidoc supports more features to allow writing even complex books

-> Github supports both
